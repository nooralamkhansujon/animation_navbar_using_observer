       The Paleocene is a geological epoch that started 66 million years ago with
      the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction of non-avian dinosaurs
      and 75 percent of all species. The Paleocene was marked by
      the recovery of the biosphere, with dense forests worldwide,
      while small mammals and birds rapidly evolved to take advantage
      of the mass extinction. In the seas, ray-finned fish rose to dominance.
      The supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwana were still separating,
      the Rocky Mountains were being uplifted, the Americas were divided,
      the Indian Plate was colliding with Asia, and the North Atlantic
      Igneous Province was forming.
